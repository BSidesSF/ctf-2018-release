With the proliferation of devices running both AMD64 and ARM processors,
sometimes it's useful to have shellcode that can run on both architectures.
Much like our other cloud shellcoding services, you're welcome to test your
shellcode!

We've made this one easy: there's a couple of files already open, I just need
you to copy the contents of one to the other.
