The modulus follows an obvious pattern.  Anyone familiar with
mulitplication of 1s produces patters like:

GP/PARI> 11111111111^2
%3 = 123456790120987654321

GP/PARI> 111111111111111111111111111*1111111111111111
%4 = 123456790123456777777777777654320987654321


The modulus can be factored by finding two large primes of all 1s.
The length of each can be read directly out of the pattern with a bit
of experimentation.

Once factored, the private key can be made, and then the session
decrypted to yield the flag:

flag[oneistheloneliestnumberthatyoulleverknow]
