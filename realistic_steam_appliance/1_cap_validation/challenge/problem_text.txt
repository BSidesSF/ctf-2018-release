1) Cup validation system

Protecting the integrity of the custom-purchased cups is of utmost
importance. Since the cup area is small we only have room for a small
QR code which will be factory-signed.  Instead of rolling our own
crypto, we've decided to go with an unbreakable industry-standard
signing algorithm using our public key:

d=0x025F2D1619EF1ABD

Our system will then scan the QR code and validate that it was
properly signed by us.  For our initial run of cups, we are shipping
them with n=0x01A3900C7CD5B305;c=0x16464fd11c039c2 which can be
validated with our private key.
