8) Cyclotron Magnet Controller

Our R&D team has discovered a way to boost the electron energy we dump
into the carbon blocks to heat our water reservoir and generate steam.
Instead of using the electrons from the Cathode Ray Tube directly, we
can feed them into a small cyclotron and give them a good energy
boost.

Engineering has struggled to generate the keys for the cyclotron
magnet controller fast enough. The main issue seems to be that the
embedded magnet controllers struggle to multiple large primes
together. Once again, Drew has come through with an ingenious solution
(this time inspired by the work of Williams). Now we retain a table of
the first 6000 primes to generate an intermediate composite.  Drew has
found a way to convert this composite into a prime using the 2nd
cyclotomic polynomial.  This has sped up our prime generation
significantly. Now we finally can keep up with the cyclotron orbit
rate.
