Realistic Steam Appliance
-------------------------

6) Cathode Ray Tube

We've been having trouble with the embedded CRT signatory service.
The encryption of messages rarely errors but when the embedded
processor signs the messages we regularly get errors.  Drew thinks
steam from the adjoining pressurized chamber is leaking into the CRT
and heating the processor to the point where it doesn't function
reliably. Bob thinks electrons from the cathode ray tube are striking
a copper heat pipe and generating a strong electric field which is
interfering with the signing operations.

We've managed to reproduce an error and capture it for you.
