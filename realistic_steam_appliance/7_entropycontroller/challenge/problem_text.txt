Realistic Steam Appliance

7) Entropy Controller

Our entropy controller samples temperature along the steam pipes at
regular intervals.  We use these temperature samples to feed our
entropy pool for cryptographic operations.  We've noticed that when
customers first turn on their Realistic Steam Appliance the
temperature readings tend to be somewhat uniform and this has been
affecting our key generation.

Once again, Drew has come up with an ingenious solution.  We now
generate two keys, one for the temp sensors slaved off the master
controller and another for the master controller.  Samples get
encrypted by the slave sensors first and then encrypted a second time
by the master controller.  By generating two keys the lack of entropy
in any given key can be counterbalanced by the double encryption.

We're confident this new design ensures we produce only the finest in
artisanally crafted ciphertext bits.
