Realistic Steam Appliance
-------------------------

0) Legacy Update

Before we start engineering our new steam appliance, we're going
through our designs for the legacy model and we need to recover the
symmetric key we used to encrypt the firmware.  Unfortunately almost
all information about how it was encrypted has been lost.  Lisa found
some old discussions about the design in her email archive.  This is
all we know:

We really need to extract the key before we can make progress. Please
help!
