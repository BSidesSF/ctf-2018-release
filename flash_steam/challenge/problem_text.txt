Good news, we figured out how the moles are stealing our design specs!
Each morning, one of them would save the documents to a USB flash
drive and hide it in the steam vent until they could be picked up by
the accomplice on the night shift.  Unfortunately after we spooked
them they abandoned the pickup plans.  We found this USB flash drive
after it had been in the vent several days and the heat seems to have
badly degraded the flash.  We can't made sense of the drive.  In
addition to all the documents, we think they were also hiding a
special message somewhere.  Can you help us find it?
