The flag is hidden in $Bitmap

The $MFT has been corrupted but can be repaired by using the $MFTMirr.

Once the $MFT is fixed, there are two corrupted lzip files, one that
has been deleted.  By recoving both and using lziprecover the lzip can
be reconstructed.

Once extracted, there is a huge PNG image inside of the lzip with a QR
Code in it that tells you how to interpret the $Bitmap file as an
image.

The solution is in morse code and translates to:

FLAG:WHATBITROTISTHIS

This could be upper or lowercase and the colon may not get included so we should accept something like:

/^(?:FLAG:?\s*)?WHATBITROTISTHIS$/i
